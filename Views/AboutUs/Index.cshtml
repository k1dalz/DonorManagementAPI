<p>Welcome to DonorManagementAPI!</p>

<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
<p>DonorManagementAPI was created to simplify and streamline the process of managing donor information, enabling organizations to focus more on making an impact. As a student passionate about technology and its potential to bring about positive change, I developed this system to address the challenges organizations face in maintaining accurate records and building stronger relationships with their donors.</p>

<h2>About the Developer</h2>
<p>My name is Muhammad Nassem Al Nooqman Bin Al Helmi, a Semester 5 student at University Poly-Tech Malaysia. My journey in software development has been driven by a desire to create solutions that make a real-world difference. This project is a reflection of that mission.</p>
